### How would this benefit the users? 
The users will be able to find the café that’s near them with a price range of the drinks.
This will help users to choose the café they're interested in. Users can also check out each café social media page, or tags 
In the social media, such as TikTok of Instagram. 

### Why would users use this application?
Sometime when we want a coffee, drinks or just a place to go when there is nowhere to really go to. You can use this application to find the best café of your choices with a reference from a multiple platform for you to check out, then choose the one that you like to visit then the app will provide users a location of the chosen café. After you have visited your desired café, it will automatically put that café into your visited café that you can chose to post it in yours other social media platforms.![image](https://github.com/PhilipHousdens/brew_finder/assets/94585775/07a917a9-9a9f-4a5d-bacd-8ec0726ac3d0)
